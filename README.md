## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Consistency Over Intensity**: Better to solve one problem daily than ten in one day
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding the logic, not just the syntax
3. **Write First, Optimize Later**: Get a working solution first, then improve it
4. **Read the Explanations**: Even if you solve it, read the solution comments for insights
5. **Experiment**: Try different approaches to the same problem
6. **Note Patterns**: Many SQL problems follow similar patterns
